      "3. **Reputation damage**: Quality problems can harm the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product introductions, and lost sales.\n",
      "4. **External disruptions**: Impact from political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents, and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, affecting Apple's customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers, and channel partners.\n",
